# M.Sc-Final-Year-Project
Facial recognition systems are crucial in biometric security, with applications ranging from access control to surveillance and user authentication. The ability to swiftly and accurately identify individuals has significantly enhanced security measures across various sectors. The decision to use Haar Cascade in this project stems from its efficiency in computation and proven success in real-time object detection. This introduction lays the groundwork for investigating a Facial Recognition System. It aims to leverage the Haar Cascade algorithm's strengths while expanding its capabilities with additional techniques. The project seeks to advance facial recognition technology by addressing common challenges in real-world scenarios, thereby improving the reliability and usability of biometric security systems. By integrating advanced computer vision methods with the robust Haar Cascade algorithm, the project aims to innovate facial recognition, providing a solution that is accurate and adaptable to various environments.

Finally you can see the algothirm accurately detect real face in live proctoring but it can distinguise the person which is in any picture or mobile phone to enhance the security while live proctoring. It can be applied to any of the scenarios where only real human face needs to be detected.
